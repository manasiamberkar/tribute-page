		<p>Chandler Muriel Bing is one of the six main characters on Friends. He was portrayed by Matthew Perry. He is notable for his sarcastic and witty sense of humor. hough Chandler never lets up by using sarcasm as a defense, he has a tendency to come off as needy and makes bad first impressions as said by Phoebe with his constant joke-making and brash demeanor. Despite this emotional immaturity, Chandler is the most financially secure of his friends. Going by his behavior in the seasons prior to him becoming involved with Monica, it is possible that Chandler has been interested in her for years.</p>
